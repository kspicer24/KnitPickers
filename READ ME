____________________________README____________________________

This project is a MySQL database with a web API acting as the front end.
The web API was built using python-flask, html, css, and javascript.

_______________________Installation Instructions______________________

This project requires the installation of the following
    1. Python
    2. Python's flask library
    3. flask's mysql extension
    4. pymysql

Flask can be downloaded through the project settings via PyCharm
    look for Flask-1.1.2 and Flask_MySQL-1.5.1 under Project/Python Interpreter in file/settings

To run follow the following steps:

    1. set up the database provided in the included dump

    2. adjust the MySQL database info in the file named app.py
        - comments signify where this is done (lines 10-13)

    3. run the project using the command $ python -m flask run from the directory where the python application files are stored

    4. click the link given to the localhost server.
        as an example, the given link on my server is http://127.0.0.1:5000/
        - This should open a browser page that will run the website


_____________________________Functionality_____________________________

This application allows users to store/share knit and crochet patterns as well as comment on them, save them in a queue,
 and filter them based on the type of stitch, category of finished product, and yarn they hold in their personal stash.

All users (registered or not) are able to access patterns stored in the database and filter based on stitch type
(knit/crochet) and category (hat, scarf, etc.).

Registered users have access to additional features including the ability to add patterns, comment on patterns,
add patterns to their personal queue, add yarn to their personal stash, and filter patterns based on the yarn in their stash.

____________________________CRUD operations____________________________

Create
    the application allows for the creation of the following:
        1. Accounts (user_member table)
            represented by username and password
            accessed by clicking log in on the home screen, and then
                create an account
        2. Patterns (pattern table)
            accessible to registered users through a link on the home page
                labeled 'add a pattern'
        3. yarn to their stash (stashes table)/(yarn table)
            adds yarnID to stash table associated with their username
            also adds yarn to yarn table if it didn't previously exist
        4. yarn to a pattern (uses table)
            add yarn to a pattern to allow others to filter by yar from the home page
            accessible from the 'add a pattern' page
        5. patterns to their queue (queues table)
            adds patternID to queues in database along with their username
            accessible by clicking link 'check out the details and join the conversation'
        6. comments to a pattern (comments_on table)
            adds a comment by that user to a specific pattern in comments_on
            accessible by clicking link 'check out the details and join the conversation'
                and clicking 'add a comment!'

Read
    the application reads the following information from the database
        1. patterns
           seen on the main screen, in My Queue, and View Pattern
        2. Yarn
seen on the main screen (drop down list for stashed yarn) My Stash, Add Pattern, and View Pattern
        3. user details
            seen with login and logout
        4. queues
            seen in My Queue
        5. stash
            seen in My Stash and main screen drop down menu

Update
    the application allows for updates in the following way
        1. users can update their description by clicking ‘edit description’ when viewing the pattern
		Only the user that uploaded the pattern can do this

        There aren't any other true updates provided.  I didn't feel they would
        make much sense. Users can still update their stashes and queues, though
        from the database perspective these operations are technically creations
        and deletions.

Delete
    the application allows for deletion in the following ways
        1. patterns
            delete from database entirely by clicking ‘delete’ on the pattern listed in My Profile
		Only the user that created the pattern can do this
            delete from queue by clicking ‘remove’ on the pattern listed in My Queue
        2. yarn
            delete from stash by clicking ‘delete’ in My Stash
        3. Comments
            delete from pattern by clicking ‘delete’ on the comment while viewing the pattern it referenced
	            Only the user that posted the comment can delete
